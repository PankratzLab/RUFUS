This project is still under development and its not considered stable but you are free to use and any feedback is welcome. 

## Download and install
```
git clone https://github.com/jandrewrfarrell/RUFUS.git   
cd RUFUS
bash Install.sh
```
This should install everything you need to use RUFUS.  If you get errors during the installation contact me at at JAndrewRFarrell@gmail.com or submit an issue.  NOTE, to date this only works on linux machines, we have not optimized for other platforms

## Running 

RUFUS is primarily used to find mutations unique to a  proband sample, that are not found in the control samples

Usage: 
```
./runRufus.sh [-s|--subject <arg>] [-c|--controls][<controls-1>] ... [<controls-n>]  [-t|--threads <arg>] [-k|--kmersize <arg>] [-r|--ref <arg>] [-m|--min <arg>] 
  [-h|--help]
 ```

 
 ```
-s,--subject: bam file containing the subject of interest (REQUIRED)

-c, --controls: bam files containing the control subjects (REQUIRED)

-t,--threads: number of threads to use (REQUIRED)

-k,--kmersize: size of Kmer to use (REQUIRED)

-r,--ref: file path to the desired reference file to create VCF (REQUIRED)

-m,--min: overwrites the minimum k-mer count to call variant (OPTIONAL, Do not provide a min unless you are sure what you want)

-h,--help: HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

 


The command line should look something like this:

```
bash runRufus.sh --subject Child.bam --controls Mother.bam Father.bam  --kmersize 25 --threads 40 --ref human_reference_v37_decoys.fa
```

or 

```
bash runRufus.sh -s Child.bam -c Mother.bam Father.bam -k 25 -t 40 -r human_reference_v37_decoys.fa
```
The flags can be provided any any order.

RUFUS can take any number control files (Must provide atleast one). 

Provide all of your control files after the [-c|--controls] flag

For Example:

```
bash runRufus.sh -s tumorT1.bam -c tumorT0.bam -k 25 -t 40 -r human_reference_v37_decoys.fa
```

or

```
bash runRufus.sh -s Proband.bam -c Mother.bam Father.bam Sibling1.bam Sibling2.bam -k 25 -t 40 -r human_reference_v37_decoys.fa
```



We recommend a kmer size of 25, 40 threads, and to NOT provide RUFUS with the optional --min parameter
